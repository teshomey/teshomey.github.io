### Summary
As a (bio)statistician passionate about uncovering data insights, I specialize in applying simple and advanced statistical techniques to address real-world problems. With expertise in methods including regression analysis, survival analysis, categorical data analysis, meta-analysis, longitudinal data analysis, Bayesian analysis, and machine learning techniques, I thrive in environments where data-driven decisions are important. Whether uncovering predictive factors in longitudinal studies or synthesizing evidence from multiple sources through meta-analysis, I'm committed to delivering rigorous and reliable analyses that inform evidence-based strategies. Throughout my career and Ph.D. work, I have also enhanced my skills in statistical analysis using industry-standard tools such as SAS, SPSS, R, and Python.
